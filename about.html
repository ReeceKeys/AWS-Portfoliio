										<h2>My Journey Into Tech</h2>
									</header>
									<p>My journey with technology began early and sparked a lasting passion for exploring and creating. Over time, that curiosity grew into a deeper understanding through hands-on experiences and formal study.</p>
									<p>Now, I continue to build on that foundation by learning, experimenting, and tackling new challenges in the expansive world of technology.</p>

										<h2>Early Life</h2>
									</header>
								<p>My love for technology started early—one of my first real tech adventures was jailbreaking my iPhone as a kid. I was fascinated by the idea of unlocking hidden features and customizing things beyond what was allowed. It taught me how powerful and flexible technology could be when you dig beneath the surface.</p>
								<p>A few years later, I built my first PC from scratch. Piecing together the components gave me a hands-on understanding of how hardware works and how every part contributes to the bigger picture. It was incredibly satisfying to power it on for the first time and know I put it together myself.</p>
								<p>But the real turning point came when I attended a coding summer camp at Stanford in middle school. That experience introduced me to programming and sparked a whole new kind of curiosity. Writing my first lines of code and seeing them come to life made me realize how much I loved building things with software—not just using tech, but creating it. Since then, I have been exploring, learning, and coding whenever I get the chance.</p>

										<h2>University Studies</h2>
									</header>
								<p>Studying Computer Science at California State San Marcos has helped tie everything together—from the curiosity I had as a kid to the skills I am building now. It is where I have been able to dive deeper into core concepts like data structures, software design, and systems programming, and actually apply them to real projects.</p>
								<p>I have worked on everything from web apps to system tools, often collaborating with classmates on team-based assignments that reflect real-world development. One of my favorite parts has been leading group projects, where I have learned not just how to code better, but how to communicate, plan, and adapt as a team.</p>
								<p>Every semester at CSUSM has pushed me to think critically, build smarter, and stay curious. It has helped shape me into the kind of developer who does not just write code—but understands how to solve problems, ask good questions, and keep learning along the way.</p>
