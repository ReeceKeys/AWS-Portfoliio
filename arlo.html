										<h2>Overview</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										During my internship at Arlo Technologies, I gained hands-on experience in both Product Development and Quality Engineering. 
										I had the opportunity to learn about the Product Development Lifecycle (PDLC), observing how teams collaborate to bring innovative products to life. 
										Additionally, I contributed to enhancing software quality using Python for automated testing and Jenkins for continuous integration. 
										These experiences deepened my understanding of how technical and collaborative efforts converge to create successful, high-quality products.

										<h2>Product Development Lifecycle</h2>
									</header>
									<p>During my internship at Arlo Technologies, I gained invaluable insights into the Product Development Lifecycle (PDLC), which is a structured approach to developing new products from concept to launch. As an intern, 
										I had the opportunity to work alongside experienced product managers and engineers, observing the stages of product development, including ideation, design, prototyping, and testing. This hands-on experience helped 
										me understand the critical steps involved in taking an idea and turning it into a market-ready product.</p>
									<p>One of the most interesting parts of concepts was understanding the importance of the collaboration between cross-functional teams. I witnessed how product managers, designers, engineers, and marketing teams worked together to ensure that 
										a product meets customer needs and aligns with company goals. This teamwork, combined with iterative feedback loops and agile methodologies, was crucial to refining the product and ensuring its success in the market.

										<h2>Quality Engineering</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										In my spare time at Arlo, I would take a dive deep into assisting the Quality Engineering lab. My role in this lab focused on using Python and Jenkins for automating testing and improving product quality. I worked on writing automated test scripts in Python, 
										which helped streamline the testing process and catch bugs early in the development cycle. Learning how to integrate these scripts into Jenkins for continuous integration (CI) was a game-changer, allowing me to run tests automatically whenever 
										code was updated, ensuring that issues were identified and resolved quickly.
									</p>
									<p>
										This experience taught me the importance of automation in maintaining high-quality software and the role of CI tools like Jenkins in supporting a seamless development workflow. By leveraging Python's flexibility and Jenkins' robust automation features, I was able to contribute to 
										improving the testing processes at Arlo. This internship not only sharpened my technical skills but also showed me how quality engineering practices, when done effectively, play a crucial role in delivering reliable and efficient products.
