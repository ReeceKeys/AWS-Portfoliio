										<h2>Classroom Systems Support</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
									As an IT Classroom Technician at California State University San Marcos, I was responsible for maintaining and troubleshooting A/V technology in classrooms across the campus. 
									My role involved ensuring that all equipment, including projectors, microphones, and sound systems, was functioning properly for professors and students. Most of the equipment was supplied by Extron.
									</p>
									<p>
									I handled real-time support during classes, quickly addressing any technical issues to minimize disruptions. This required a solid understanding of various A/V setups and the 
									ability to troubleshoot problems under pressure to ensure smooth learning experiences.

										<h2>Compliance Script</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
									During my time as an IT Classroom Technician at California State University San Marcos, I developed a systems compliance script in C# to ensure that classroom technology and systems met our internal standards. 
									The script automatically checked various settings and configurations, such as software versions, network configurations, and peripheral devices, verifying they were aligned with university guidelines. 
									This proactive approach helped streamline our workflow by identifying compliance issues before they became problems, reducing downtime and ensuring a consistent user experience for both faculty and students.
									</p>
									<p>
									The script not only saved time by automating the compliance checks but also provided valuable reports that could be used for troubleshooting or auditing purposes. I implemented features that allowed the script to flag any discrepancies making it easier for the team to prioritize and address any issues. By automating these checks, I was able to help maintain high standards across all classrooms and reduce manual oversight, 
									allowing the IT team to focus on more complex tasks and ensuring a seamless classroom experience for everyone.
